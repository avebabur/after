    <h1 class="title">"AFTER" BOOK</h1>
    <h2 class="firstwords">
      Maybe about my life or someone in my life, or about an experience that
      happened in the past
    </h2>
    <h2 class="type"><b>ROMANTIC & DRAMATIC</b></h2>

    <h2 class="chapters">DEAR READERS</h2>
    <p class="Montserrat">
      Let me provide a brief overview of my book titled "After." The reason for
      this title is that four years ago, a wonderful person came into my life.
      Since this girl appeared, many things began to change. Therefore, the
      ideology of this book revolves around the situations that occurred after
      she entered my life. The idea to write this book came to me two years ago.
      At that time, I would jot down notes on my phone. After another two years,
      I have finally completed writing the book today.
    </p>

    <h2 class="chapters">TO SUMMARIZE</h2>
    <p class="Montserrat">
      the book is about me and the girl I fell in love with. It briefly recounts
      what happened between us over a period of 2 years and 117 days. The book
      describes actions from 2021 to 2024. (You will be able to read the full
      story in the book for a complete understanding.)
    </p>

    <h2 class="chapters">PURPOSE FOR WRITING</h2>
    <p>
      My purpose for writing is that during the time we were talking, we had
      many plans together, one of which was to write this book. So, even though
      we don't talk now, I want to ensure that this plan is realized by writing
      and publishing it. Another reason is that her arrival in my life sparked
      my interest in writing, even though I wasn't initially interested in
      reading.
    </p>

    <h2 class="chapters">LOVE CHANGES A PERSON</h2>
    <p>
      During the three months I spent writing this book, I experienced various
      emotions. Sometimes, events struck me deeply, and at other times, I found
      myself reminiscing and feeling nostalgic. After all, we are human; we
      often miss and think about people from our past. Until now, I had never
      loved a girl like this. Perhaps because of that love, I began to change in
      ways I never expected. On one hand, this person has brought significant
      benefits to my life; she helped me discover my hidden talents and
      encouraged my growth in many areas. One of these talents is playing the
      piano. I fell so deeply in love with her that, knowing she liked boys who
      could play the piano, I started learning it myself. To understand the
      authenticity of my feelings, you can find out by scanning the QR code
      below..
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapters">PROPOSAL</h2>
    <p>
      If I keep talking about this person, there’s so much to say. Perhaps
      that's why a book was written. So instead of explaining everything in
      detail, it’s better to read the book. There, all the events from the
      period between X.IX.MMXXI and V.I.MMXXIV are summarized.
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapters">BOOKS</h2>
    <p>
      This book is just the beginning; I plan to write three more books in the
      future. You can find a brief overview of them below, along with some
      information about what they are about.

    <h2 class="thanks chapters">THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION</h2>
    <p class="thanks pb">
      I hope everyone will read the book and share their feedback. If anyone has
      any questions or doesn't understand something, feel free to reach out to
      me on my social media; I'll always try to clarify any confusion. I want to
      thank everyone involved in the book, including the characters, those who
      helped with the design, and everyone who provided support. And of course,
      thanks to the wonderful person in the book who contributed to the creation
      of this masterpiece, coming into my life. I look forward to everyone's
      Support, and I hope you appreciate my three months of hard work. Happy
      reading, everyone!
